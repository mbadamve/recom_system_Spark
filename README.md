# Recommendation System on Spark
In this project, the aim is to build a recommendation system on Spark using Alternate Least Squares (ALS) algorithm.

The dataset is taken from a Kaggle competition called 'WSDM - KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge', where it contains information of users listening to songs, source where it is played etc.

By leveraging this data, feature engineering is done to identify which is the genre, artist and language user mostly listens to and from this data, it is possible to recommend top songs in the category.
