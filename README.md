# Recommendation System on Spark
In this project, the aim is to build a recommendation system on Spark using Alternate Least Squares (ALS) algorithm.

The dataset is taken from a Kaggle competition called 'WSDM - KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge', where it contains information of users listening to songs, source where it is played etc.

By leveraging this data, and appropriate feature engineering it is possible to identify which is the genre, artist and language user mostly interested in and from this data, it is easy to recommend top songs in that category.
